        <h2>Taoo Trivia</h2>
        <aside class="aside">
          <details> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tacos were first mentioned in the United States in 1905, around the time that Mexican migrants began arriving to work on railroads and in mines. Tacos were initially considered low-class street food because they were inexpensive and filling, and were often eaten in working-class neighborhoods. By 1920, Mexican immigrants began to combine their food with American ingredients, and what became known as the "ultimate taco" to Americans began to emerge. 
            The taco shell, typically made from a fried tortilla in a "U" shape, was a game-changer for popularizing tacos. The first Taco Bell was opened by Glen Bell in Downey, California in 1962, serving what his customers called "Tay-Kohs". Today, tacos are available almost everywhere, from local street food stands to Chipotle.
